**RBYI, because some might misunderstand me**

《 Do not ***COPY*** or **take inspiration** from my skins/cosplays, I always done mine's by myself and my hard work, have originality :/ .  》

《 Mentally neutral chaotic and silly, unless I vibe with you. My mood and social battery affects how I interact with you, that goes the same if you brought me out of my comfort zone. 》

《 Dry to talk to, unless I've talked to you before or I connect with your interests with mine's. ( I'm more comfy around my friends or my friend's friends ), other than that, I'm socially awkward, please take note. 》

《 I usually sit with friends and go AFK, I don't want weird things happening in front of me while AFK. Lastly I don't tolerate uncomfortable scenarios and would temporarily hide you without notice. 》

《 Usually AFK or Semi-AFK on PT due to watching YT or I might be on Discord, just whisper me ( compliments are okay too ). 》

^《 Following this: I have cos/skins that says I'm AFK/Semi-AFK, please keep that in mind. Also, please whisper me if I'm AFK, I'll probably respond more better that way so your messages wouldn't get burried. 》

《 I love doing cos/skins similar with friend's particular interests on Pony Town, if you wanna do so w/ me, feel free to ask. Ships are limited unless we're very close, if I know your ship preferences, or I'm neutral about your favorite ships. 》

《 If we're friends on Pony Town, tell me, bc I usually don't recognize who adds me. Whichever cos you recognize me as or if a have my socials on it. ( I usually forget to add notes on my end, especially if we never conversed before, I sincerely apologize ). 》

《 If you're just gonna add me for friend count, I couldn't care less, because there are super, duper rare, or once in a blue moon occurrence that *I* do initiate a conversation with a stranger, especially if I'm in the mood. 》

^《 Did I already say I'm introverted?... and socially awkward?... 》
