**Simpler RBYI, because some might misunderstand me**

《 Mentally neutral chaotic and silly, unless I vibe with you. My mood and social battery affects how I interact with you, that goes the same if you brought me out of my comfort zone. 》

《 Dry to talk to, unless I've talked to you before or I connect with your interests with mine's. I'm socially awkward, please take note. 》

《 I usually sit with friends and go AFK, I don't want weird things happening in front of me while AFK. Lastly I don't tolerate uncomfortable scenarios and would temporarily hide you. 》

《 Usually AFK or Semi-AFK on PT due to watching YT,  just whisper me ( compliments are okay too ). 》

^《 Following this: I have cos/skins that says I'm AFK/Semi-AFK, please keep that in mind. Also, please whisper me if I'm AFK, I'll probably respond more better that way so your messages wouldn't get burried. 》

《 I love doing cos/skins similar with friend's particular interests on Pony Town, if you wanna do so w/ me, feel free to ask, ships are limited unless we're very close or I'm neutral about your fave ships. 》

《 I don't add friends or add you back, unless I've talked to you more than five times ( that's the bare minimum ). If you're just gonna add me for friend count, I couldn't care less, because there are super, duper rare, or once in a blue moon times that I do initiate a conversation. 》
