**Simpler RBYI, bc some might misunderstand me**

《 Mentally neutral chaotic and silly, unless I vibe with you. My mood and social battery affects how I interact with you, that goes the same if you brought me out of my comfort zone. 》

《 Dry to talk to, unless I've talked to you before or I connect with your interests with mine's. I'm socially awkward, please take note. 》

《 If I don't sit with you that means I don't know you personally ( no offense ), or I ( or you ) don't have a 'c+h' tag 》

^《Following this: I probably just wanna sit with you ( with the same fandom as you ) so I could hide and AFK. 》

《 Usually AFK or Semi-AFK on PT due to watching YT, just whisper me ( compliments are okay too ). 》

《 I have cos/skins that says I'm AFK/Semi-AFK, please keep that in mind. Also, please whisper me if I'm AFK, I'll probably respond more better that way so your messages wouldn't get burried. 》

《 I love doing cos/skins similar with friend's particular interests on Pony Town, if you wanna do so w/ me, feel free to ask, ships are limited unless we're very close or you are very close with me. 》
